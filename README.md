# Getting Started with Create React App

Develop a table component to display a list of applications, ensuring it is user-friendly and provides interactive features for easy navigation. Fetch the list of applications from the backend API and display it in the table. Handle loading states and error messages for scenarios where data retrieval fails.o	Allow sorting by columns such as Application No, Applicant Name, or Application Date.Implement pagination if there are more than a set number of applications (e.g., 10).Add a search bar to filter the list of applications by Applicant Name, Status, or Student ID.
